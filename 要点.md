####类型转换

Swift中不存在隐式类型转换.


####关于隐式解包:(在Basic章节)

`optional` 用来指明允许一个variable或者constant have "no value". 我们可以使用`if` statement 来检测其是否有"value", 并且可以根据condition来解包获取其值, 这样我们就可以使用"optional binding" 来使用它的值了(在if的body里). 而有时我们确认某个optional量在初始化过后,总是有值的. 这种情形下我们就没必要每次都去检测optional的量是否有值并且解包获取其值. 因为我们是假定它是一直有值的. 这种optional量就叫做`implicitly unwrapped optional`量. 我们可以这么书写
```Swift
let assumedString: String! = "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."  //
```

####Swift中的self(在Method章节)

Every instance of a type has an implicit property called self, which is exactly equivalent to the instance itself. You use the `self` property to refer to the current instance within its own instance methods.

####Closure

  Closures are reference types. When you assign a closure to a property, you are assigning a refrence to that closure. 

A capture list defines the rules to use when capturing one or more reference types within the closure's body. As with strong reference cycles between two class instances, you declare each captured reference to be a weak or unowned reference rather than a strong reference. The appropriate choice of weak or unowned depends on the relationships between the different parts of your code.

* a ?? b 等价于 a != nil ? a! : b

* Swift中, 任何对所有properties进行了初始化并且没有自定义initializer的 结构体(structure)或者(class), 都默认有一个`default initializer`, 比如:
```Swift
class ShoppingListItem {
  var name: String?
  var quantity = 1
  var purchased = false
}
var item = ShoppingListItem()
```
* Not every type in Swift can be compared with the equal to operator(==). 

* 调用方法时, 参数列表的第一个参数名可以省略, 剩下的不可以;
* A constant declaration defines an immutable binding between the constant name and the value of the initializer expression; after the value of a constant is set, it cannot be changed. That said, if a constant is initialized  with a class object, the object itself can change, but the binding between the constant name and the object it refers to can't.

Unlike stored named values and stored variable properties, the value of a computed named value or a computed property is not stored in memory.

* If a closure is called after the function returns, any changes that closure makes to the in-out parameters do not get copied back to the original.

* Class与Structure都可以定义properties和methods来拓展功能.
